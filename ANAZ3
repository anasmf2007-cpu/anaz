Got it! I’ll assume you want a 3-swap operation in Python, which usually means swapping three elements in a list in a cyclic manner. Here's a clean example:

def three_swap(lst, i, j, k):
    """
    Cyclically swaps elements at positions i, j, k in the list.
    
    lst: list of elements
    i, j, k: indices of elements to swap
    """
    lst[i], lst[j], lst[k] = lst[k], lst[i], lst[j]
    return lst

# Example usage
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Original list:", my_list)

# Swap elements at indices 0, 1, 2
swapped_list = three_swap(my_list, 0, 1, 2)
print("After 3-swap:", swapped_list)
