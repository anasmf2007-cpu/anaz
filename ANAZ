Here is a simple Python program for dividing two numbers:

# Program to divide two numbers

# Taking input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Checking if the second number is zero
if num2 == 0:
    print("Error! Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    result = num1 / num2
    print("The result of division is:", result)
